	Usage: $SCRIPT [-m <maximum>] [-n <workdir>] [-w <warmup>] [<file>]
	       $SCRIPT -h

	Reload and use a VCL on a running Varnish instance.

	Available options:
	-h           : show this help and exit
	-m <maximum> : maximum number of available reloads to leave behind
	-n <workdir> : specify the name or directory for the varnishd instance
	-w <warmup>  : the number of seconds between load and use operations

	When <file> is empty or missing, the active VCL's file is used but
	will fail if the active VCL wasn't loaded from a file. The <file>,
	when specified, is passed as-is to the vcl.load command. Refer to
	the varnishd manual regarding the handling of absolute or relative
	paths.

	Upon success, the name of the loaded VCL is constructed from the
	current date and time, for example:

	    $(vcl_reload_name)

	Afterwards available VCLs created by this script are discarded until
	<maximum> are left, unless it was empty or undefined.
