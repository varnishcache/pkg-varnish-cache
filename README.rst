Packaging files for Varnish Cache
=================================

This repository contains the necessary scripts to package up Varnish Cache.

How to build
------------

The flow is roughly:

1) Set up the build environment. On Redhat that is mock, on Debian/Ubuntu you
   need sbuild.
2) Put the Varnish Cache .tar.gz archive into sources/.
3) Run ./package-deb or ./package-rpm.


Branch structure
----------------

This repository will contain a master branch and zero or more
maintenance branches.

master should be used to build the last stable release _and_ the development
release, all the way up until development diverges enough that it isn't
useful/possible any more.

At that point, a maintenance branch should be branched off. These should be
deleted from git 12 months after the release is end of life. Before deletion,
a git archive of the branch should be extracted and made public.

If you can work around branching, do it. Rather have one slightly untidy
packaging ruleset, than two/three slightly different that needs to be kept in
sync.
